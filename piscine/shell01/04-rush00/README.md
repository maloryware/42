# Rush 00

Rush exercises are team exercises open during the weekend for pisciners to do in randomly assigned groups.

For Rush 00, the goal is to draw a square with a given set of characters, which vary depending on exercise, line and position within a line.

To accomplish this, we build two loops: one to iterate over every line (taking a `y` value as the maximum height), and one to iterate over every character of each line (taking an `x` value as the maximum width).
