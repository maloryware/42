Like most exercises in this chapter, it's mostly a matter of developing the muscle memory of checking a command's manual (`man`) every time we want to know more about it, its flags, and its parameters.

Interestingly, here the major point to get through is that sometimes you'll find there is a manual for subcommands! In this case, `man git log` opens the manual for `git-log`.

The two parameters used are `pretty` (an alternative to `format` with a few slight changes, but a, well, prettier name) and `-n`, for which the "n" is optional.

Equally important to note with `man` is that by typing forward slash (`/`), you can search for standard text matches in the manual.
