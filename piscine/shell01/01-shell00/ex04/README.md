midLS - Explore the parameters of the ls command. The approach taken is as simple as opening the manual for the `ls` command (through `man ls`).

There's three required flags minimum, one of which can be changed around.

The flags I used were:
- `-m: fill width with a comma separated list of entries`;
- `-p: append "/" indicator to directories`;
- `-t: sort by time, newest first`.
