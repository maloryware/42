# okay so, display 'cat /etc/passwd' with the following wincons:
# 1 - remove comments
# 2 - every other line starting from the second (sed -n "2~2p")
# 3 - reverse each login
# 4 - sort by reverse alphabetical order
# 5 - keep only logins between FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2 (including)
# 6 - separate by ', '
# 7 - end output with a '.'
