Self explanatory - create a file titled 'z' and have its contents be only 'Z'.

For this effect, I used the built-in text editor "nano", by running `nano z`, which opens a nano text editor window where the data we put inside it will be, by default, saved to the file named 'z'.

Within nano, simply typing `Z` (and making sure there are *no* leading newlines, as Moulinette, the automated evaluation bot, will make a fuss about it) and saving it with `ctrl + w, ctrl + x` concludes the exercise.
