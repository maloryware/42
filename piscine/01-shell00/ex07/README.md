An introduction to patching files, and the diff tool. I didn't quite get it at first, but being familiar with git and version control, it clicked pretty fast.

A diff file is obtained by comparing two files, and provides a description of how the changes between them can be carried out. This diff file can be used by the patch command to, well, apply a patch to the original file, either directly or by outputting the result to a separate file.
