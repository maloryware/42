# 42 Network - Don't Panic!

As a (currently pisciner, but hopefully soon to be) student of 42 Lisbon, there are multiple projects that I must undertake.

For the sake of documenting my journey, providing a portfolio of capabilities and allowing people to learn from my own code, I have moved to host all my projects on a public Github repository.

I'll also add READMEs to each exercise describing my thought process and how I solved the problem.
