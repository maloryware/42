# 42 Network - Don't Panic!

As a (currently pisciner, but hopefully soon to be) student of 42 Lisbon, there are multiple projects that I must undertake.

For the sake of documenting my journey, providing a portfolio of capabilities and allowing people to learn from my own code, I have moved to host all my projects on a public Github repository.

I'll also add READMEs to each exercise describing my thought process and how I solved the problem.

## General Information

- While the pdf files with the instructions are legally 42's, the **code** is mine, and it is licensed under **[gcamerli](https://github.com/gcamerli/42unlicense)'s 42 Unlicense.** You're allowed to edit and redistribute it at will. It is provided as-is, with no warranty.
- All code written and every goal achieved has been **without any usage of any Generative AI** (LLMs, GPTs) whatsoever. I do not trust AI tools, I do not consider them a good tool for learning code, and I vehemently oppose their usage.
- If this repository is of any help to you, leave a star or a comment! If you're a 42 student and find this repository, I urge you to do your best to solve these exercises by yourself then come back to revise!
